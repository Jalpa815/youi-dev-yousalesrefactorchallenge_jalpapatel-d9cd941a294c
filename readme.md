# Coding Challenge

Thanks for giving me the opportunity for this refactoring exercise. 

Code Review Document 
-	Access Modifiers 
-	public: The type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.
-	private: The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct.

Don’t need to change anywhere in a code for access modifiers. 

-	Inheritance concept  - Applied on policy class because more policies will be add in future ,
One way to build this would be to create a base Policy class, and create sub-classes for CarPolicy, MotorCyclePolicy, and HomePolicy – with each sub-class handling the details for the different way of Policy

- Composition  - Instead of creating more subclasses we can try to using  composition .

DDD concepts – Domain Driven Design concepts applied on all classes of code means all code put in different layers like BLL , DLL and Presentation layer .
